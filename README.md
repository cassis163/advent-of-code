# Advent of Code solutions
Why do I give myself homework? What a jackass.

## Languages to learn
### Most desired
* Go (cause I don't like Java and PHP, but I need a productive backend language)
* Rust (ofc)
* C (back to the basics)
* Elixir (cause it's different)
* Haskell (cause it's also different)
### Maybe
* Zig (is this even worth it after Rust and C?)
### Probably not, but will consider
* Assembly (why torture myself?)
* OCaml (dead language sadly)
* Perl (shoot me in the head if I start dressing like Larry Wall)
* Erlang (not worth it if I'm going for Elixir I guess)
* C++ (not sure if this is worth it after Rust and C)
