Trying to learn the basics of some languages by solving some fun AOC coding problems.

My solutions are probably inefficient, but screw that.. They are mine! :D

## Languages to learn
### Most desired
* Go (mainly for backend systems)
* Rust (see what all the hype is about)
* C (understanding the basics of C will benefit my understanding of other languages)
### Maybe
* Haskell (imperative programming seems weird and interesting)
* Zig (maybe a cool language?)
* Elixir (developers seem to like it)
* C++ (maybe check this out after learning basic C)
### Probably not, but will consider
* Assembly (maybe this is worth it somehow, probably not though)
* OCaml (not sure to be honest)
* Perl (seems to be great for scraping documents for data)
* Lisp (promises to be a very unique language, so I'm curious)
* Kotlin (Java, but less painful?)
* Scala (also Java, but less painful?)
## Languages that I'm OK with
* Python
* TS
* JS
* Java
* Lua
* PHP
* C#
## Concepts that I want to learn
* Macros (Rust)
* Memory management (C, Rust)
* Borrowing (Rust, not even a fanboy but genuinely curious as an outsider)
* Null-safe abstractions (Rust)
* Modern error handling (Go, Rust)
* Parallel processing (Go, Rust)
